This package has one goal: to spread the word of Ron Swanson.

![](https://github.com/corysauve/dukesilvR/blob/main/inst/img/pyramid.jpg)

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("corysauve/dukesilvR")
```
## Swanson-isms

To get a Swanson-ism, simply:
```{r example}
library(dukesilvR)
ron_says()
```

`ron_says()` returns one quote by default. If you want multiple, simply define them with `n=`:
```{r}
ron_says(3)
```
